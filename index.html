    <p style="text-align: center; font-size:xx-large;">Welcome to a community of volunteers who want to use their computer's capabilities to make a difference in the world.

        We are currently developing a platform that is reliable, secure, and easy to use. Our aim is to ensure that every member who joins our network feels safe and confident while contributing their computer's power to our cause.
        
        To join our network, you can simply download our software onto your computer. Once you've installed the software, your computer will automatically become part of our network.
        
        We are excited to bring this network to you soon and will keep you updated with any developments. Get ready to make a positive impact on the world!</p>
